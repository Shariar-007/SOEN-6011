## 🧠 Function F8 – σ (Standard Deviation)

This project is a Java-based GUI implementation of the **σ (sigma)** function, interpreted as the **standard deviation** of a list of numbers.
The GUI was built using **Java Swing** and adheres strictly to the D2 Problem 5 constraint: implemented entirely **from scratch**, without using Java Math libraries such as `Math.sqrt()` or `Math.pow()`.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Accepts comma-separated real numbers as input
- 🧮 Computes **population standard deviation**
- ✅ Manual implementation of:
  - `square(x)`
  - `sqrt(x)` using Newton-Raphson
  - `absolute(x)`
- 🎨 Intuitive and responsive **Java Swing GUI**
- 🔁 Handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully
- ❌ No dependency on external libraries or IDE

---

## 💡 How to Compile and Run (No IDE Needed)

1. **Open Terminal / Command Prompt**
2. Navigate to the directory containing `SigmaCalculatorGUI_Final_Compliant.java`
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
javac SigmaCalculatorGUI_Final_Compliant.java
java SigmaCalculatorGUI


## Example
+---------------------------------------------+
| Enter numbers separated by commas:          |
| [   3.5, 5.0, 8.25, 6.0, 4.75   ]            |
|                                             |
| [ Calculate Standard Deviation ]            |
|                                             |
| Result: σ = 1.5285                          |
|                                             |
|                                             |
